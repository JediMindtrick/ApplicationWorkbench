We (CredAbility) are a non-profit that provides counseling and assistance to people who are 
facing foreclosure or bankruptcy. Both our clients and counselors are geographically 
dispersed throughout the US so it is critical for us to utilize technology wherever possible to 
minimize overall delivery costs. 
 
Our IT department is small (approx. 5 developers) and we build applications that support our 
counselors in delivering services. Please consider us for free desktop user licenses. 
 
Thank you,

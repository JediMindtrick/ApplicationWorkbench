Grouping:
0. How to group -> select many, then Ctrl+g

1. How to ungroup -> select a group, then Ctrl+shift+g 

2. Custom symbols should probably be preferred over grouping.  

3. Grouping is not accounted for in the transform step (yet, and maybe never).  

4. It appears that symbols inside a group may have x,y-origins relative to their containing group ()

Navigation:
1. right-click on a control to get an option to set a custom Id and custom data
2. Ctrl+g to group controls
3. to create a symbol ->
	0. create an "assets" directory in the same directory as your mockup file
	1. make sure your file has been saved
	2. group some controls
	3. right-click -> edit properties -> give the group a name (this is what will display in control browser)
	4. save again (just for good measure, not sure it's necessary)
	5. right-click -> edit properties -> "Convert to Symbol"
	6. symbols are saved in symbols.bmml

Exported xml:
1. .bmml files are the same as exported xml!!

2. width and height sometimes uses "w" and "h" attributes, but sometimes uses "measuredW" and "measuredH" attributes.  it seems that if using one set, the other is set to -1


Custom symbols:
Here is an example custom symbol:
    <control controlID="4" controlTypeID="com.balsamiq.mockups::Component" x="463" y="75" w="198" h="77" measuredW="198" measuredH="77" zOrder="0" locked="false" isInGroup="-1">
      <controlProperties>
        <override controlID="1" x="7" y="7" w="-1" h="-1">
          <text>Net%20Income%3A</text>
        </override>
        <override controlID="2" x="94" y="4" w="96" h="-1">
          <text>NetINcome</text>
        </override>
        <override controlID="3" x="7" y="41" w="-1" h="-1">
          <text>*NetIncome%20Error%20Message</text>
        </override>
        <override controlID="0" x="0" y="0" w="198" h="77">
          <customData>some%2520custom%2520data</customData>
        </override>
        <override controlID="-1"/>
        <src>./assets/TextInputSet.bmml#TextInputSet</src>
      </controlProperties>
    </control>

0. have a controlTypeID of "com.balsamiq.mockups::Component"

1. do not export labels,ids,text or other nodes contained in the symbol definition, but if you override them then the appropriate nodes are added

2. containing controls seemed to be numbered by controlID, once set the controlID seems consistent for any given control (ex. the only input control would always show up as controlID="1" or whatever it is assigned).  this means the only way to tell which control is which is by figuring out what ID number got assigned to a given control and making the transform code account accordingly

3. have a "type" that is set in the control's /controlProperties/src node
custom symbols ex:
      <controlProperties>
        <src>./assets/lib1.bmml#Pulldown</src>
      </controlProperties>

4. can exist more than one in a given file.  this can be used to create libraries

5. you can change the properties on an instance of a custom-symbol by double-clicking it and then double-clicking on whatever control you want to change

5. you can edit a previously designed custom symbol by double-clicking it and then choosing the option to "edit source"
